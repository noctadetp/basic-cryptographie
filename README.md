# Simple Python Cryptography Tool

This is a simple Python cryptography tool that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using a basic character shifting algorithm. The tool does not rely on any external cryptography modules and is meant for educational purposes only.

## Features

- Encrypts a message by shifting each character by a given key.
- Decrypts an encrypted message by shifting each character back by the same key.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as other characters.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the script
4. Follow the prompts on the terminal to enter your message and encryption key.

## Disclaimer

This tool is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used for any sensitive or critical data. The encryption algorithm used in this tool is basic and not suitable for secure communications. It is highly recommended to use established and secure cryptographic libraries for real-world cryptography needs.
